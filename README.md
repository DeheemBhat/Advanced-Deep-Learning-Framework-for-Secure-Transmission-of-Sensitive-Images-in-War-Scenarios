Advanced Deep Learning Framework for Secure Transmission of Sensitive Images in National Security Scenarios
Overview
This project presents a deep learning-based framework for the secure transmission of sensitive images in scenarios related to national security, such as war and border protection. The framework ensures the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted images by using advanced encoding and decoding techniques. It employs Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography and state-of-the-art deep learning models such as ResNet50, VGG16, and Inception_v3 for image encoding and decoding.

The framework is designed to safeguard sensitive image data, minimize data corruption, and ensure lossless decoding, making it a valuable tool for critical national security applications.

Features
Deep Learning-Based Encoding: Securely encode sensitive images using advanced architectures (e.g., ResNet50, VGG16).
LSB Steganography: Used for decoding the encoded images with high accuracy.
Data Integrity Validation: Comparison between original and decoded images to ensure minimal loss or corruption during transmission.
Secure Transmission Pipeline: Focused on protecting data confidentiality and integrity in national security scenarios.
Experimental Validation: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in secure image transmission.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
A GPU with CUDA support (optional but recommended for training models)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-image-transmission.git  
cd secure-image-transmission  
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Download pre-trained models (if applicable):
Follow the instructions in the models/README.md file to download pre-trained weights for ResNet50, VGG16, and Inception_v3.

Usage
1. Encoding an Image
To encode an image using the framework:

bash
Copy
Edit
python encode.py --input <path_to_image> --output <output_encoded_file>  
2. Transmitting an Image
Securely transmition of the encoded image to the desired destination (implementation depends on your transmission method, e.g., network protocols).

3. Decoding an Image
To decode a previously encoded image:

bash
Copy
Edit
python decode.py --input <encoded_file> --output <decoded_image_path>  
4. Validation
To compare the original and decoded images:

bash
Copy
Edit
python validate.py --original <path_to_original_image> --decoded <path_to_decoded_image>  
Reports and Presentation
The repository includes:

Project Report: Detailed documentation of the framework, its design, implementation, and experimental results.
Presentation (PPT): Summary of the project, methods, and outcomes.
Both the report and the presentation can be found in the repository under the docs/ folder.

Experimental Results
